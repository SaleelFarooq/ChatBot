The products those come under the scope of this chatbot are Patient Monitoring Sytems  
. The User who will be seeking help of this chatbot will be a clinical person who can understand the medical terminologies related to Patient Monitoring Systems.
The  requirements of that will come as input to the chatbot will be dependent of the needs of the user and the organisation/hospital which he/she represents.
